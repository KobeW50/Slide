# Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy for Slide
At Slide, we take the issue of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) with the utmost seriousness. We are committed to providing a safe environment for our users and ensuring compliance with legal standards to combat CSAE.
Reporting and Handling CSAE Content

Slide is a third-party client for Reddit, meaning that content displayed in the app is sourced directly from Reddit’s platform. Slide does not host or manage content independently; it provides an alternative user interface for browsing Reddit. As such, the handling of CSAE-related content is primarily governed by Reddit’s content policies and moderation systems.

However, Slide is equipped with a Content Reporting Feature, allowing users to flag inappropriate or harmful content directly through the app. Reports made through Slide are forwarded to Reddit’s moderation teams, where they are reviewed and addressed in accordance with Reddit’s CSAE policy.

Reddit’s CSAE policy involves:

    Immediate Action: Reddit proactively removes and reports CSAE content to relevant law enforcement agencies and organizations, such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).
    Moderation Team Review: Subreddit moderators and Reddit’s internal safety teams are empowered to enforce strict policies against CSAE content.
    Account Bans and Legal Reporting: Accounts associated with CSAE content are permanently banned and reported to legal authorities.

# Slide’s Role
As Slide does not independently host or store any content, it relies on Reddit’s established policies and systems for the detection, removal, and reporting of CSAE content. Slide’s Content Reporting Feature serves as an additional layer to ensure that users can flag harmful material effectively and contribute to Reddit’s moderation efforts.
Commitment to User Safety

Slide supports Reddit’s zero-tolerance policy toward CSAE. We are committed to:

    Maintaining and improving the in-app reporting feature to make it easier for users to report harmful content.
    Collaborating with Reddit to address user concerns promptly and transparently.
    Educating users about safe online practices and available reporting mechanisms.

If you encounter content that violates CSAE policies, please use the reporting feature in Slide or Reddit to alert the moderation team. Together, we can help create a safer online community.
