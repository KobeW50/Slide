# Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy for Slide
At Slide, we take the issue of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) with the utmost seriousness. We are committed to providing a safe environment for our users and ensuring compliance with legal standards to combat Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).

# Reporting and Handling CSAM Content

Slide is a third-party client for Reddit, meaning that content displayed in the app is sourced directly from Reddit’s platform. Slide does not host or manage content independently; it provides an alternative user interface for browsing Reddit. As such, the handling of CSAM-related content is primarily governed by Reddit’s content policies and moderation systems.

However, Slide is equipped with a Content Reporting Feature, allowing users to flag inappropriate or harmful content directly through the app. Reports made through Slide are forwarded to Reddit’s moderation teams, where they are reviewed and addressed in accordance with Reddit’s CSAE/CSAM policy.

# Slide’s Role
As Slide does not independently host or store any content, it relies on Reddit’s established policies and systems for the detection, removal, and reporting of CSAM content. Slide’s Content Reporting Feature serves as an additional layer to ensure that users can flag harmful material effectively and contribute to Reddit’s moderation efforts.
Commitment to User Safety

Slide supports Reddit’s zero-tolerance policy toward CSAM. We are committed to:

    Maintaining and improving the in-app reporting feature to make it easier for users to report harmful content.
    Collaborating with Reddit to address user concerns promptly and transparently.
    Educating users about safe online practices and available reporting mechanisms.

If you encounter content that violates CSAE policies, please use the reporting feature in Slide or Reddit to alert the moderation team. Together, we can help create a safer online community.

For more information on Reddit’s CSAE policies and how they address these issues, please refer to Reddit’s official Content Policy and Safety Resources.
